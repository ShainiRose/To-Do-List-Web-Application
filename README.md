## Simple To-Do List Web Application 

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run "npm install" to install dependencies.
4. Start the application by running either "npm run dev" or "npm start" in the terminal.
                (e.g: C:\Users\Documents\todo-app>npm run dev OR C:\Users\Documents\todo-app>npm start)
   
6. Open " http://localhost:3000 " in the browser.

## Assumptions
- This app uses in-memory storage, so tasks are lost when the server restarts.
- Frontend communicates with backend using HTTP requests.

## Features
- Add, view, and delete tasks.
- Update tasks with a new title and description using a prompt-style dialog box.
- Mark tasks as complete by toggling a checkbox.
- Visually distinguish completed tasks with a background color and strikethrough text.


## Future Improvements
- Persist data using a database or local storage.
